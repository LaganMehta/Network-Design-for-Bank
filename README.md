# Network-Design-for-Bank
</br>In this project we will primarily focus on design and implementation of Bank Network using 
Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT). Security breach in the sector of banks is one of the most important 
concerns that needs to be addressed in the first place since loss of information can lead to huge 
losses to the bank overall. This project will help us curb such concerns by understanding the 
regulated flow of information/data. We will consider a national bank which has its head offices 
located in big cities like Chennai. The other small branches will be present in cities like 
Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy, Salem, and Thirunelveli. These small branches in each state will 
be connected through LANs. Apart from this, VLANs and WANs will automatically be a part 
of the project networking since we are working on a Bank Network. Additionally, bank 
machines will be made available all around each city in specific to ensure better reach and 
reliable services to the people. Employees use a special software to access user accounts. The 
level of access to advanced resources within the bank varies from employee to employee based 
upon several criteria which include the designation of the employee, criticality of the 
information etc. The typical servers, mail, web, files and directories will be made available to 
all the employees to understand the flow of work within the bank.
